## GUPPI Tool Source

This is a GUPPI tool source. Tools are organized as subdirectories,
each containing a `pyproject.toml` with `[tool.guppi]` metadata.

## Adding Tools

Create a new tool directory:

```bash
mkdir my-tool
cd my-tool
# Create pyproject.toml with [tool.guppi] section
```

See https://github.com/samdengler/guppi-cli for more information.
